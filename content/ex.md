### Basics

ex is the base of vi

```shell
ex -vnE /some/text/file <<EOF
some ex commands
some other ex command
and now we will save and quit
wq
EOF
# -V verbose
# -n no temporary buffer
# -E extended ex mode (vi -E, ex -E, vim -E, exim are the same)
```

### Syntax

[address] command [options]

### Addresses

- x,y,z = number or symbol
- n,m = number

### Options

"command**n**" repeats command n times.
- 3d = deletes line 3
- d3 = delete 3 lines

When it matters:
- "%" = current file
- "#" = previous file

**!** indicates a variant of the command. ("command" variant = "command**!**"), cf. commands for description of variants.

Same as k. Return later to the line with 'x (apostrophe plus x, where xis the same as char). Vim also uses uppercase and numeric characters for marks. Lowercase letters work the same as in vi. Uppercase letters are associated with filenames and can be used between multiple files. Numbered marks, however, are maintained in a special viminfo file and cannot be set using this command.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Only leading spaces and tabs are added or removed when shifting lines. count specifies the number of lines to shift, starting with address. The shiftwidth option controls the number of columns that are shifted. Repeating the < or > increases the shift amount. For example, :>>> shifts three times as much as :>.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
