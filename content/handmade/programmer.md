This is all but my own definition...

## What is a programmer?

**An individual that produces an interpretable record of information describing a transformation.**

| Individual                  | can a computer be a programmer??? ultimately binds into free will...                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Interpretable               | that's the difference between a recipe and scramble eggs... Scramble eggs contain all the information about how to make scramble eggs (given a certain context), but it's scrambled in in such a way that we could consider as non interpretable for most practical purposes. |
| Record                      | is somebody doing an air painting, even masterfully, a painter. I would argue not, I would describe him as an artist but not a painter. The act production is as fundamental to the programmer as it is to the painter.                                                       |
| Information                 | that's a hard one....                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Describing a transformation | I think this is a hard classifier, what distinguishes a program from everything else (we can't say data there, as programs are data)                                                                                                                                          |

## What is a program?

Well...

**~ a record of information describing a transformation**

Does the program need be runnable? Debatable

Does the program need be unambiguous, I argue not.

## What is a computer?

**An entity that can run a program to transform inputs into outputs.**
