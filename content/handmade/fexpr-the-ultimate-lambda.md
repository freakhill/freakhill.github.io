[This article](http://www.dalnefre.com/wp/2011/11/fexpr-the-ultimate-lambda/) introduces an antique
Lisp construction called ["Fexpr"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fexpr) under the prism of the
[Vau calculus](http://lisp.esthlos.com/papers/jshutt.pdf).

I rewrote its code in clojure for (self)educational purpose, and added comments here and there
to make it more understandable for the common folk (mainly myself).

I find the subject quite interesting and I hope my small contribution will be of interest to somebody!

[Here is the source!](https://github.com/freakhill/fexpr-test/blob/master/src/fexpr_test/core.clj)

It's not pretty but it's not obfuscated (i think...). You can browse through the code in parallel of
reading the [original article](https://github.com/freakhill/fexpr-test/blob/master/src/fexpr_test/core.clj)!
