3d games focus all the action in close range, with low pushback and lots of evasive moves with keep you close (duck, sidesteps etc.). they want you in there. they generally have very little moves that are plus on block (so each player gets to press button). consequences of this are throw that are techable on reaction, and standblock (or button block), also default "best block" is standing and not crouching. 3d games is all about moving in that space, calling out the enemy by avoiding his attacks and punishing, or calling out fake strings. (also knowing your option selects...)

2d games will space out the game a lot more on the horizontal axis with lots more pushback than in 3d games, and strings of uninterruptible buttons. 2d games tend to have much rich mid range and far range play. (also jumps, short jumps, super dashes etc.). Being very close range
