Type theory people like to make things horribly confusing when there is absolutely no need to. Evil, evil people.

How will we do that, layman explanations, pascal notation, color coding if possible! When things get dense, always add a legend!

This will be a work in progress for a long long time.

This will contain a bunch of stuff I will study, it's not a book, it's not a tutorial, at best it's a bunch of notes written in order to understand a bunch of stuff through the type theory domain, in a very sparse non exhaustive manner.
