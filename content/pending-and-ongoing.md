## Mini book reviews, starting from the 17th of march 2019

#### [The book of numbers](https://mennohenselmans.com/the-myth-of-1glb-optimal-protein-intake-for-bodybuilders/)

Some interesting parts about finding what sequences of numbers are?

Most of it was not too interesting to me...

I don't remember the result exactly but there was something really interesting, there are only 7 (or 9? or another random number) bases possible to cleanly factorize numbers with gaussian primes (primes in the complex plane). I found that fascinating when I read it! There are some numbers like that, that are not 1, or 2, or some prime, or e, or pi, or a humonguous number, just a 7 or a 9! That was the most fascinating math stuff I has read for a while.

#### [Hidden order](https://www.amazon.com/Hidden-Order-Adaptation-Builds-Complexity/dp/0201442302)

Building a model to simulate what is pompuously called "cas", which is pretty much emerging complex behaviours from simple agents. Lots of quite interesting parts about biology! Relatively light in bulshit even though it has its part.

It has pretty nice content on what might be the beginnings of the discipline. Might be worth a reread when I get to my MMO game!

#### [SOA Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/SOA-Patterns-Arnon-Rotem-Gal-Oz/dp/1933988266)

This book has good informative content! But it is written in an extremely laborious way... This was a huge bore to read, painful... Many parts did not resist the test of time. We can probably extract a relevant and relatively timeless 40p books out of this ~250p book.

### [The craft of scientific presentations](https://www.amazon.com/Craft-Scientific-Presentations-Critical-Succeed/dp/1441982787/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1NQPC0QH5UH98&keywords=the+craft+of+scientific+presentations&qid=1573460610&sprefix=the+craft+of+scientif%2Caps%2C324&sr=8-1)

Excellent content! Very practical advices on how to prepare and deliver slide based presentations, valid for not only scientists, but also engineers (and maybe/probable others). However the book repeat itself so much that I think it could easily be cut in half. I understand repeating yourself a little, but that much repeating should be reserved for 500+ p. books... The author also has a passion for namedropping. Honestly you could cut that book by 2/3rd and keep the content intact, some limited repeating included.

Still I recommend the read!

### [Designing Distributed Systems](https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Distributed-Systems-Patterns-Paradigms-ebook/dp/B079YTM4FC)

This is basically a kubernetes tutorial... There is good content in this but it is like a fifth or a tenth of the book. At least the kubernetes parts are quick to skip. A few hours read.

### [Domain-Driven Design](https://www.amazon.co.jp/-/en/Evans-Eric-ebook/dp/B00794TAUG/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=domain+driven+design&qid=1609494586&sr=8-1)

This is a thick book... I enjoyed it as one would enjoy reading a mix of a dictionary and a theological studies book... This was a slug. There are maybe ~50p of valuable-to-me stuff in there, food for thoughts. Read the bits about ubiquitous language, bounded contexts, the 17th part, then breeze through stuff written in bold, and you should be fine.
